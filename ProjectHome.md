Adasim is a simulator for solutions to the automated traffic routing problem.
It allows modeling of vehicles, traveling on a map, while completing for resources.
Adasim allows for modeling of sensor noise and agent privacy.

See the [description of the automated traffic routing problem](http://seams.self-adapt.org/wiki/ModelProblem:ATRP).  For a more technical description of the problem and of Adasim, see the technical paper ["TrafÔ¨Åc Routing for Evaluating Self-Adaptation"](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/brun/pubs/pubs/Wuttke12seams.pdf).

To learn how to use and extend Adasim, see the [user manual](UserDocumentation.md).
